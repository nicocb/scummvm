# SpeakerEasy: Real PC Speaker Sound for ScummVM

## A Personal Story

Some of my best childhood Christmas memories are tied to LucasArts games. I remember unwrapping Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Secret of Monkey Island, and Loom. Back then, I played them on an 8086 with floppy disks, a CGA monitor, and a PC Speaker. No Sound Blaster, no AdLib - just that iconic beeper producing surprisingly expressive music and sound effects.

Decades later, I rediscovered these games through ScummVM. The experience is incredible, but something was missing: that distinctive PC Speaker sound. The software emulation is technically accurate, but hearing those tones through modern speakers feels different. It's like the difference between a photo of a place and actually being there.

**SpeakerEasy** is my *madeleine de Proust* - a project to recreate that authentic beeper experience. When I hear Indiana Jones' theme through a real speaker, I'm transported back to Christmas morning, sitting in front of that old PC, completely absorbed in adventure.

## What is SpeakerEasy?

**SpeakerEasy** is a simple protocol for routing PC Speaker sound to real hardware. The current implementation supports an ESP32-based external device, but the protocol is designed to be extensible to other backends (native Windows Beep API, Linux console speaker, etc.).

### The Protocol

SpeakerEasy uses a minimal 5-byte packet format:

```
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ CMD (1 byte)     │ Frequency (2B)  │ Duration (2B)   │
│ 0x06 = NOTE      │ Little-endian   │ Little-endian   │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

- **Frequency**: Hz value (0 = silence)
- **Duration**: Optional, in milliseconds (0 = until next note)

### Melody File Format (.spez)

SpeakerEasy defines a simple binary format for storing PC Speaker melodies:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Note 0: Freq (2B) + Duration (2B)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Note 1: Freq (2B) + Duration (2B)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ...                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each note is 4 bytes (little-endian):
- **Frequency**: uint16, Hz (0 = silence/rest)
- **Duration**: uint16, milliseconds

This format can be used to record game audio or create standalone PC Speaker music files.

### Implementations

The protocol can be implemented by any device or program that reads from a serial port, named pipe, or Bluetooth SPP connection.

#### ESP32 External Hardware (Current)

An ESP32-based device receives SpeakerEasy packets via Serial or Bluetooth SPP and drives a piezo speaker.

- **Connection**: USB Serial or Bluetooth SPP
- **Baud rate**: 115200, 8N1
- **Bluetooth UUID**: `00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- **Firmware**: [TODO: Add repository link]

#### Named Pipe Backend (Project)

The ScummVM implementation treats named pipes just like serial ports. This means it should be possible to create a bridge program that reads from a named pipe and drives a real PC Speaker - without any changes to ScummVM itself.

A proof-of-concept Python implementation is provided in `dists/speakereasy/speakereasy_beep.py`. It creates a named pipe and attempts to play tones using the system's native beep capability.

| Platform | Pipe Path | Beep Method |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Windows | `\\.\pipe\speakereasy` | `winsound.Beep()` |
| Linux | `/tmp/speakereasy` | `beep` command or `ioctl(KIOCSOUND)` |

**⚠️ Why I couldn't test this properly:** I only have access to a Windows PC with a motherboard speaker, but no admin rights. The Windows `Beep()` API has significant overhead (~10-30ms per call), making it unsuitable for real-time streaming of short notes (16-32ms). The result sounds muffled and choppy. Direct port I/O (via InpOut32) would bypass this limitation, but requires installing a signed kernel driver - which I cannot do without admin access.

On Linux, direct access to the PC Speaker via `ioctl(KIOCSOUND)` on `/dev/console` should work much better, but requires root privileges. If you have a Linux machine with a PC Speaker and root access, you could potentially make this work.

**This is why external hardware like the ESP32 remains the recommended solution** - it provides true real-time playback without OS-level limitations or privilege requirements, and delivers the authentic PC Speaker experience.

## What Was Done

### Core Implementation

- **New driver**: `audio/softsynth/speakereasy.h/.cpp` - Cross-platform serial communication driver
- **Protocol**: Simple 5-byte packet format: `CMD_STREAM_NOTE (0x06) + Freq(2 bytes) + Duration(2 bytes)`
- **Integration**: Hooks into existing `Player_V2` PC Speaker emulation in SCUMM engine

### Platform Support

| Platform | Connection Method | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Windows  | Serial (COM port) or Bluetooth COM | Tested |
| Linux/macOS | Serial (`/dev/ttyUSB*`, `/dev/tty.*`) | Implemented |
| Android  | Bluetooth SPP via JNI | Tested |

### GUI Integration

- New "Hardware" tab in Global Options
- Checkbox to enable/disable SpeakerEasy
- Text field for port/device name configuration
- Layout support for all themes (highres/lowres)

### Optimizations

- **Frequency deduplication**: Only sends notes when frequency changes (avoids Bluetooth lag)
- **Efficient protocol**: Minimal 5-byte packets for low latency

## Testing Performed

- **Windows**: Tested with Bluetooth COM port (COM9) on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
- **Android**: Tested on Huawei Kirin 970 device with Bluetooth SPP
- **Games tested**: Indiana Jones 3, Maniac Mansion intro

## Configuration

### Windows (Serial/Bluetooth COM)
```
speakereasy_enable=true
speakereasy_port=COM9
```
